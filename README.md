## Design Process :clock330:

As mentioned earlier, the website target players and users that are interested in sci-fi franchise. And the website featured a variety of exciting features that allow users to explore each and every.

Before we came out with the idea of how the website should look like and the layout and color schemes, we gather information and indentify how we can make the website more interactive to enhance users' experience when experiencing the website. Therefore, we decided to apply multiple hover interactions that users can play with and striking background movement that could catch the users attention.

Then, we start creating a wireframe for our webpage that showcases the layout of the website on how it should look like that gives us a clearer idea on how we should start progressing our project.

##### **Here is the wireframe for our project:**

And the overall appearance of the webpage looks very much the same on both laptop and on mobile screen, in fact it may be a little smaller on mobile view.

Throughout the way of this project, we've faced different bugs and challenging problems that requires us to fix. One of interesting bugs or problems we've discovered during our testing is that our background star animations tend to goes off without looping continuonsly. But, we've found out which sections that causes this issue and had successfully solved it. Apart from this, we also encountered that after switching the theme from dark mode to light mode the color of the mode toggle button doesn't change along. However, after using local storage to set the selected theme and to get the previous selected theme by getting item we fixed the issue. Additionally,
